Jude Bellingham became the first player to score in each of his first four Champions League appearances for Real Madrid as they saw off spirited Napoli.

The England midfielder headed in David Alaba's cross in the 22nd minute to put the 14-time winners 2-1 ahead.

It was the 20-year-old's 15th goal in his 16th appearance for Los Blancos.

He also assisted the fourth goal for Joselu in added time as Real continued their perfect record in this season's Champions League with a 4-2 win.

"He's spectacular in getting into the box, he comes into the box like a motorbike," Real manager Carlo Ancelotti told Movistar Plus.

"It's surprising because nobody could have imagined such fast adaptation here, to this club and the football he is showing. He surprises the fans, team mates and even rivals."

Giovanni Simeone opened the scoring for the visitors in the ninth minute but Rodrygo's brilliant curling effort brought Real level two minutes later.

"I am leaving this campaign, but I will never leave the fight for conservative values," he wrote in a statement addressed to his supporters.

The 64-year-old lost the support of many Republican voters when he publicly broke with Mr Trump over the 6 January Capitol riot in 2021, and when he presided over the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election results in Congress.

Mr Trump admonished Mr Pence for lacking "courage" when he refused to overturn the Democratic leader's election victory.

Some rioters were heard chanting "hang Mike Pence" as they stormed the halls of Congress in 2021, and since then many Trump loyalists have viewed him as a traitor.

The former vice-president said in March that Mr Trump's encouragement of the rioters had "endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day".

In his resignation, Mr Pence did not endorse any other Republican candidates for the presidential election.

But he called on Americans to choose a leader that "will 'appeal to the better angels of our nature' and not only lead us to victory but also lead our nation with civility and back to those time-honoured principles that have always made America strong, prosperous and free."

Mr Pence's decision to withdraw from the Republican presidential campaign came shortly before the third presidential debate on 8 November.
