Despite the result, there were plenty of positives for Buttler's side to take, particularly in the batting department.

Their World Cup disappointments emanated from tentative starts, and an out-of-form batting line-up struggling to impose itself on the bowlers in testing conditions - a stark contrast from the champion side of 2019, of which the foundations were built on aggression, intimidation and owning the powerplay.

However, through the early onslaught of Jacks and Salt, both absent from the World Cup, England resorted to old methods with new faces.

Salt led the charge, whacking three sixes in his 28-ball 45 while Jacks struck 26 from 24, leaving West Indies' bowlers weary and struggling for answers.

When both fell in successive overs, the rebuild was led by the Test openers, with Zak Crawley adding a patient 45 and Ben Duckett 20 before Brook's 71 set the platform that allowed Curran and Carse to launch.

Concerns remain over the form of Buttler, who made just three from 13 balls, and all-rounder Liam Livingstone, who scored a scratchy 17.

In a series billed as one to kick-start England's new era, head coach Matthew Mott will need performances from both experienced campaigners in order to build the side around them.
